# si-tatvasoft
This project is a part of my 15-days summer internship (done at Tatvasoft).  [https://www.tatvasoft.com/]
Backend part is working perfectly fine. (don't forget to connect with the database.)
For the frontend part, you may face 404 or sometimes 405 errors. And also many a times CROS policy error.
If you are running/testing on local, don't forget to change the base url. (You can find that in frontend -> services -> request.ts file.)
